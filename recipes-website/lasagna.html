    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>To make lasagna, start by cooking the lasagna noodles according to the instructions on the package. Drain the noodles and set them aside. In a separate pan, cook the ground meat (such as beef, turkey, or a combination) with some chopped onions and garlic until the meat is browned. Drain any excess fat from the pan. Next, add your choice of tomato sauce to the cooked meat mixture and let it simmer for a few minutes. You can season the sauce with herbs like basil, oregano, and a pinch of salt and pepper for extra flavor.

        Now it's time to assemble the lasagna. In a baking dish, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom. Place a layer of cooked lasagna noodles on top, followed by a layer of ricotta or cottage cheese. Sprinkle some shredded mozzarella cheese over the cheese layer. Repeat these layers until you run out of ingredients or reach the top of the baking dish. Make sure to finish with a layer of sauce and a generous amount of mozzarella cheese on top.
        
        Cover the baking dish with foil and bake in a preheated oven at 375°F (190°C) for about 25-30 minutes. Then, remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes until the cheese on top is golden and bubbly. Once done, let the lasagna cool for a few minutes before serving. This classic Italian dish pairs well with a side salad and garlic bread. Enjoy your homemade lasagna!</p>
